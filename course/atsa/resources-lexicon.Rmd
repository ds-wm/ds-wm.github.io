The following definitions are based on the textbooks (Woodward and Crawley) unless otherwise noted.

Autocorrelation ($\rho$)
:   - TBA

Autocovariance ($\gamma$)
:   - covariance within the same time series

Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
:   - see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality

Correlation
:   - the degree to which two variables are linearly related; see also Pearson correlation coefficient

Covariance
:   - the measure of joint variability of two random variables; positive, negative or near zero

Continuous parameter
:   - a numeric parameter that can take any value from a specified range of values, for example $T = (-\infty, \infty)$; compare against a **discrete** parameter

Deterministic
:   - TBA

Discrete parameter
:   - a numeric parameter that can take any value from a specified range of values, limited by a minimum permissible distance between each value, for example $T = \{0, \pm1, \pm2, ...\}$; compare against a **continuous** parameter

Ensemble
:   - the collection of all possible realizations

Ergodic
:   - a process whose ensemble averages can be consistently estimated from a single observation (e.g., u(t) doesn't depend on t)

Gaussian (normal)
:   - TBA

Identically distributed
:   - a collection of random variables where each random variable has the same probability distribution as the others; if these random variables are also mutually independent, they may be given the shorthand notation IID

Mean ($\mu$)
:   - the expected value (E) or first raw moment of a real-valued random variable (e.g., $X(t)$), oftentimes denoted: $E[X(t)]$

Observation
:   - a real number from a given random variable

Probabilistic
:   - TBA

Random variable
:   - a variable whose values depend on outcomes of a random process; it can be thought of as a function that is defined in some sample space whose range is the real numbers

Real number (${\rm I\!R}$)
:   - a value from a continuous quantity that can represent a distance along a line (includes all positive and negative rational and irrational numbers)

Realization
:   - a set of real-valued outcomes for a random variable at a fixed location in the random variable's sample space; compare against an **ensemble**

Stationary
:   - a process that is in a state of statistical equilibrium; examples include strict stationarity, covariance stationarity

Stochastic process
:   - a collection of indexed random variables from the same sample space

Time series
:   - a special type of stochastic process where the sample space represents time

Univariate
:   - having or involving a single variable

Variance ($\sigma^2$)
:   - the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean; see also [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) and [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance)

White noise
:   - TBA
