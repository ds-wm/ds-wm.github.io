The following definitions are based on the textbooks (Woodward and Crawley) unless otherwise noted.

Autocorrelation ($\rho$)
:   - TBA

Autocovariance ($\gamma$)
:   - covariance within the same time series

Correlation
:   - the degree to which two variables are linearly related; see also Pearson correlation coefficient

Covariance
:   - the measure of joint variability of two random variables; positive, negative or near zero

Stochastic
:   - a collection of indexed random variables from the same sample space

Deterministic
:   - TBA

Probabilistic
:   - TBA

Random variable
:   - TBA

Real number
:   - TBA

Mean ($\mu$)
:   - the expected value (E) or first raw moment of a real-valued random variable (e.g., $X(t)$), oftentimes denoted: $E[X(t)]$

Time series
:   - a stochastic process where the indexes represent time

Continuous
:   - TBA

Discrete
:   - TBA

Observation
:   - TBA

Realization
:   - a set of real-valued outcomes

Ensemble
:   - the collection of all possible realizations

Stationary
:   - a process that is in a state of statistical equilibrium; examples include strict stationarity, covariance stationarity

Ergodic
:   - a process whose ensemble averages can be consistently estimated from a single observation (e.g., u(t) doesn't depend on t)

White noise
:   - TBA

Identically distributed
:   - TBA

Gaussian (normal)
:   - TBA

Variance ($\sigma^2$)
:   - the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean; https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance; https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance

Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
:   - see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality
