### Check Library Versions
You can list the versions of the libraries (i.e., packages) you have loaded in your current session.

1. Load the packages into the current session.

    ```R
    library("tswge")
    ```
1. Check the session info for a list of library names and their versions

    ```R
    sessionInfo()
    ```

### Save History File
A part of your deliverables is to turn in your session history for assignments.
You can save and load your command history from a current session (see [here][lshistory]).

1. Save current session's history to a file.

    ```R
    savehistory(file = "Davis_2021-01-27.Rhistory")
    ```
1. You can load this to a new session, so as to keep a current "full log" of your coding work.

    ```R
    loadhistory(file = "Davis_2021-01-27.Rhistory")
    ```
