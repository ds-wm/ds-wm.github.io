### Code Snippets
The following code snippets provide quick tutorials on specific tools, datasets, or concepts.
The snippets are written in R using a Jupyter Notebook hosted on a cloud environment provided by [Google Colab](https://colab.to/r).
A Google account is required to connect and run these snippets.


[Install Package and Check Session Info](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IuULZkusjNlO-LMrPhNfiq3UGKWauDCi?usp=sharing)
:   If you haven't already installed the `tswge` package, here's how to do it and also how to load the library into the runtime and check to see what version of each loaded package is available.

[Plot GPX Data](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HTY5wuII0AlJY2EtkqhBqKp_f7KRk__3?usp=sharing)
:   In this code snippet, we look at how to read and parse an XML-based GPX data file to extract the timestamps and plot speed against time.

[Reading and Processing Data for Lab 1](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LQYV32w2alxA8AMwlJC2PHjAyfs58I5M?usp=sharing)
:   In this code snippet, I show you how to read a non-HTML and HTML plain text file that contain time series data into a time series object in R.

[Save and Load R History](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y-PPvuDylFYHzyvj8jNgJvjaxbxSH0NX?usp=sharing)
:   For assignments (and for your own sake) you can save all the commands you have typed in an R session to a text file, typically called the .Rhistory file.
    In this code snippet, you will see how to save your history file and load it back into a given session.

[R Time Series Quick Fix](https://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/R_toot.htm)
:   This quick fix is meant to expose you to basic R time series capabilities and is rated fun for people ages 8 to 80.
    This is NOT meant to be a lesson in time series analysis.
