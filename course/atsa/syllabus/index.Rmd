Course Description
==================

This course is structured to teach a specific data science skill set, provide ability to perform hands-on research employing a particular method, and ultimately produce an independent research project.
Students shall learn about and discuss relevant topics and research associated with time series analysis.
Some of these sessions will be designated as hands-on laboratory sessions in which students write code to replicate and perform analyses using R.

The course will place a focus on the code and implementation choices necessary to perform applied time series analysis.
Throughout the semester students shall replicate several time-series studies and provide replication code and analyses as part of their lab assignments.

Students must apply time series skills learned throughout the course to answer their own research questions.
Students shall brief progress on their projects throughout the semester as well as the final project and results during the last couple weeks of the semester.

Course Objectives
=================
1. Learn a specific data science skill
1. Perform research employing a particular method
1. Produce an independent research project

How these are interpreted
-------------------------
These course objectives were created by another professor and I will try my best to adapt to them.

In my opinion, LO#1 is the understanding and application of analytic methods associated with time series data.
Data science is all about understanding patterns in data and time series is a special class of data.
To accomplish this learning object, we will dive right into what makes a time series and what are the methods for analyzing it and applying it.
There is basic lexicon associated with this topic, which I am compiling [here][lexicon].

Learning any coding language is invaluable; however, it is my belief that there is value in learning the free/open-source varieties as they are easily ported between operating systems and can follow you after college without the concern of expensive or proprietary licensing.
Therefore, I have added the caveat to the course description and chosen to use R rather than STATA.
You may disagree with my decision, but trust me, if you can figure it out in the open source community, you should have no trouble picking it up in the proprietary flavors on your own.

LO#2 emphasizes our ability to recognize time series data and the classical methods for analyzing them.
To accomplish this objective, we will investigate published methods and (attempt) to reproduce them.

LO#3 was a curve ball when I read it.
I hoped that this could be more of classical lecture, but there you go.
Now we have an independent research task tacked on to this course.
My goal is to narrow the scope and limit the data to give this more structure all while allowing you to make independent choices on your data and methods.
We'll see how this goes.

[lexicon]: https://ds-wm.github.io/course/atsa/resources-lexicon.html

What you should already know
----------------------------
* Basic computer skills (text and document editing; websites and web forms; reading, writing and manipulating files and folders)
* Basic computer programming principles (e.g., functions, loops, if/then cases, file IO)
* Basic probability and statistics (e.g., expected value, variance, standard deviation, correlation, magnitude, real vs. imaginary numbers)

What is expected of you
-----------------------
* Meet twice a week virtually;
    * be on time and courteous to your classmates
    * join the class with your audio and video turned on (i.e., get yourself a pair of headphones with a mic)
* Provide a course evaluation at the end of the term with a summary of things you liked and disliked; methods that worked for you and those that fell short; topics that interested you and those that were uninteresting.

What to expect from your instructor
-----------------------------------
* Meet with you twice a week
* Answer questions and provide feedback as requested through email, chat, discussion board forums or other electronic means in a timely manner
* Manage all web resources
* Post videos to introduce/explain concepts and guide you through demos
* Make accommodations for video chat requests during and/or outside scheduled office hours

Course Structure
================

How this class is stylized
--------------------------
This class meets approximately twice a week for one hour and twenty minutes.
The course is divided into three topical blocks:

1. Intro to Time Series and R
1. Data Analysis for Applied Time Series
1. Intro to Modeling and Prediction

Each block is between 8 and 10 class periods and consists of a series of lessons, in-class exercises, a discussion paper, one lab, and one exam.

How class time is used
----------------------
In general, I will follow this path through each of the three blocks:

1. Lesson (2--3 classes)
1. Exercises (1--2 classes)
1. Discussion (2--3 classes)
1. Lab + Exam (2--3 classes)

How this class is assessed
--------------------------
The grading for this semester uses a simplified __check system__.
Each check you get is worth a certain number of points, based on the following table.

:   Table 1. Check categories and their associated point values.

| Category | Points |
| :------- | -----: |
| Lessons  | 0 pt |
| Exercises | 1 pt |
| Labs | 2 pt |
| Exams | 2 pt |
| Discussions | 2 pt |
| Notes | 1 pt |
| Research Project | 2 pt |

Exercises
:   Exercises should be completed using either the R command line or RStudio.
    For each block, submit your in-class exercises to the GitHub repository as two plain-text files:

    1. Rscript: using either the command line or RStudio, produce the lines of code to complete the exercises, including your name, class, date, and text (as a comment) for each question.
    1. Rhistory: save all your commands from your session(s) and upload your history file to accompany

    All exercises are due on or before the exam due date for a given block.
    Use your GitHub username and block number to name your files, for example: block 1 exercises should be titled: `dt-woods_b1.R` and `dt-woods_b1.Rhistory`.

    If you have submitted exercises for all three blocks, they were submitted on time, they produce the expected outputs and run without errors, you will receive a check.
    Exercises that are late, incomplete, or throw errors will not receive a check.

    _Be sure to test your R scripts!_

    You are free to collaborate on class exercises, but you are expected to submit your own work (see [Coursework Policy][#coursework-policy]).

Labs
:   Labs should be completed using the R kernel in Google Colab; it is free to use with a Google account, such as the account associated with your W&M email.
    Labs should include relevant text blocks to introduce topics, explain methods, display images/graphics, and link to resources.
    Labs should include relevant code blocks to read, process, analyze and visualize data.
    Labs should be formatted like a report with the following sections:

    1. Introduction - a 150-300 word introduction to the purpose and scope of the lab
    1. Methods - a reproducible account of your work made up of code and text blocks of all steps leading up to, but not including the final graphics, tables or figures
    1. Results - final figures, tables and/or other graphics with explanations of what they represent
    1. Discussion and Conclusions - a 250 to 500 word reflection on your methods and results, what worked and what didn't work, what were the challenges you faced, were the results as you expected, what inferences (if any) can you make
    1. References - a list of all citations used throughout the report; every reference must be cited and all citations must show up in your references. Please use the latest APA guidelines for your citation style.

    To receive a check for a lab, submit your .ipynb or a link to your shared Jupyter Notebook to GitHub; if sharing a link, please make certain share permissions allow for W&M user access.
    Notebooks are expected at minimum to meet the following:

    1. be formatted correctly,
    1. be written in English with minimal typos (see [Standards for Submitted Work][#standards-for-submitted-work]),
    1. include working links to datasets,
    1. include code blocks that execute without errors,
    1. include figures that adhere to the guidelines given,
    1. include references, each with appropriate in-text citations,
    1. include captions for all tables and figures, and
    1. include responses that answer the question(s) asked.

    All labs are due on or before the exam due date for a given block.
    Two of the three labs will be assessed (chosen randomly; you do not get to choose which ones).
    If they meet the criteria, each will receive a check worth 1 pt.
    Late labs, incomplete labs, or labs that fall short of expectations will not receive a check.

    You are free to collaborate on lab assignments, but ultimately it should reflect your thoughts, methods, and conclusions (see [Coursework Policy][#coursework-policy]).

Exams
:   Exams will be given near the end of each of the three main topic blocks and consist of one or more questions.
    Answer the question(s) to the best of your ability and submit your response(s) to Blackboard.
    Two of the three exams will be assessed (chosen randomly; you do not get to choose which ones).
    An exam submission that satisfies at least 75% of the expectations will receive a check; an exam that scores less than 75% of the expectations will not receive a check.

    You should work independently on the exams.

Discussions
:   We will examine and review at least one published article for each of the three blocks.
    Discussions are assessed based on your participation, which may consist of any of the following:

    1. Actually talking and sharing your ideas and opinions during a live class session
    1. Typing your thoughts and opinions in the discussion board on Blackboard (limit 500 words)
    1. Recording your thoughts and opinions and posting the audio file in the discussion board on Blackboard (limit 5 minutes)

    Participation in all three discussions receives a check.
    Failure to participate in one or more discussions does not receive a check.

Notes
:   You are encouraged to take notes during class.
    This practice is an invaluable learning aid.
    The class will be broken up such that each of you will be assigned to submit notes for one of the three blocks.

    These notes should be neat, organized, formatted in markdown and titled using your GitHub name and block number (e.g., `dt-woods_notes-b1.md`) and uploaded to GitHub at least 48 hours before the exam due date.
    Notes serve as a study guide for all students and help by providing additional perspectives, methods, and note-taking styles.

    Submitting a complete set of notes in a single markdown file for your block results in a check.

Independent Project
:   A musical application of time series analysis.

Standards & Policies
====================

The Code of Conduct
-------------------
By the basis in which this class is designed, these things hold true:

1. This class utilizes several forms of communication (e.g., instant messaging, discussion boards, emails, audio/video conferencing), of which not all can be monitored by the instructor at all times.
2. You are responsible for how you interact with each other.

Remember these things as you work together:

1. "Don't ascribe maliciousness to that which can be explained by inadvertence."

    This comes from the fact that it is almost impossible to portray our feelings or intended meaning behind typed text.
    If something offends you, take a breath, be cordial and ask for clarification before unleashing your wrath (BTW: you shouldn't unleash your wrath).
    That being said, also do not be a silent witness.
    If something offends you, let everyone know.
    We will never learn from our mistakes if our mistakes are never pointed out.
    If malicious actions continue, the instructor will manage it.
2. "There is no innovation and creativity without failure. Period."

    You are a college student registered in a college class.
    You are not expected to know everything.
    The entire purpose of this exercise is for you to gain knowledge, so make an effort.
    If you want to try something, try it and let everyone know what you are up to.
    Best case scenario, your innovations spark new insight.
    Worst case scenario, we all learn something from your efforts.
    Remember: there are no right answers to these projects---just creative approaches, innovative designs and happy accidents---so don't be afraid to make a mistake.
    It's better to aim high for something that will make a difference rather than to play it safe with something easy.
3. Ask lots of questions.

    Questions are cheap, so ask a lot of them.
    When asking questions, remember to always strive for clarity.
    If you don't know something or your aren't sure, just ask.
    Sometimes, knowing the right question to ask is just as difficult as finding the answer.
    When you find yourself here, please send up a flare or simply say "I'm lost."
    We will get you back on track.
4. Focus on opportunities.

    Remember: this is not a race and you are not a judge, so don't get caught up with critiquing or competing with each other.
    Provide your opinions and perspectives and then actually take the time to read the opinions and perspectives of others.
    Challenge yourself to see things differently and try things differently.
    Ignore your desire to be correct or to correct someone else and try not to contradict people; they don't like it and biologically it shuts down their ability to see things logically.
5. Document and share everything.

    While it may feel natural to keep your work private, projects really thrive when you document your process publicly.
    By writing things down and sharing them, more people can participate along the way and you might get help on something you didn't even know you needed.
    This leads to more things being documented, which produces a better project roadmap, which leads to better transparency and feedback, which leads to good decision making and faster/better results.

    We cannot manage what we do not measure: so digitize your process!!!
6. Everyone is bound to uphold a policy of respect for their instructor and their peers.
    Students should be open-minded to new ideas and participate in collegiate debate, the sharing of ideas, and the receiving of feedback without defamatory remarks.
    Students should help maintain a healthy learning environment by refraining from negative behavior, such as harmful remarks, quibbling over trivial matters, creating unnecessary debates, or bullying.

    **There is zero tolerance for negative behavior. Failure to uphold this policy will result in punitive action and/or removing the offending student from access to all or part of the class.**


Engagement Policy
-----------------
- *Weekly virtual engagement is required.*

In this asynchronous virtual classroom, engagement is defined loosely as your interaction with one or more of the web-based communication tools.

It is expected that you interact at a minimum with the posted discussions, chats, issues, emails, and/or video conferencing once a week.
Failure to do so may negatively influence your final grade.

Please make any and all planned absences (e.g., field trips, vacations, athletic events) that would result in you not being able to meet this minimum interaction known to your instructor at the earliest possible time.


Coursework Policy
-----------------
- *You are bound by the honor code.*

By accepting admission to the College, you have made a commitment to understand, support, and abide by the [Honor Code](https://www.wm.edu/honor).
**Violations, whether attempted or successful, will result in consequences ranging from a verbal reprimand up to a failing grade for the class**.

Misconduct may include, but is not limited to, the following:

- cheating or using unauthorized materials on assignments
- fabrication, forgery, alteration, or destruction of documents; hacking unauthorized resources; intimidating or bribing peers; improper collaboration or colluding; plagiarizing; or lying in order to obtain academic advantage
- assisting others in misconduct
- attempting misconduct


Instant Messaging Policy
------------------------
- *The instant messaging app should be used for communication that either: (1) needs to reach people quickly or (2) needs a quick response.*

You are free (and encouraged) to create your own GroupMe groups with classmates for better/faster communication.
Do not use the instant messenger for spamming, soliciting or otherwise disrupting the peace.
Be sure to change your notification settings on your mobile device to provide "Do Not Disturb" periods when sleeping or studying.


Email Policy
------------
- *All personal correspondence should be made to the instructor's W&M email address ([see above](#course-syllabus)) and include the class title in the subject line.*

For private inquiries, please email the instructor; the instructor will confirm each email received.
If you do not receive a confirmation message from the instructor within 12 hours of sending, feel free to send a follow-up email.


Make-Up Policy
--------------
- *There are no make-ups.*

Evaluation dates should be suggested by the student and approved by the instructor.
If, for some reason, you are unable to meet during the scheduled time or turn in your performance accomplishments on time, you may email the professor before the regularly scheduled evaluation date to reschedule it at a mutually convenient time or else receive an unsatisfactory score.
Under rare circumstance, students may request an incomplete; the acceptance of which is at the sole discretion of the instructor.


Standards for Submitted Work
----------------------------
- Written (and/or typed) work should be in English and follow, to the best of your abilities, the rules of the English language (see [Strunk & White](https://faculty.washington.edu/heagerty/Courses/b572/public/StrunkWhite.pdf)).
- Written (and/or typed) work should be neat, thorough, legible, and logically organized.
