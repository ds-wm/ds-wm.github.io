# The Data Pipeline

> "If the time to build an automated pipeline is less than the time you might spend doing/redoing things manually, it's a good time investment"

The goal of a data pipeline is to automate as much of the process as possible.
This saves time and avoids human error when performing the same (or similar) tasks repeatedly.
