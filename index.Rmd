__Data Science__ is the study and application of methods that extract knowledge from frequently large, diverse sets of data.
These data can come from anywhere, for example: newspaper articles, satellite images, or genomes.

The goal of the Data Science program is to prepare students for careers that explore patterns in large data sets and identify potential trends and insights.
This program will teach students relevant skills (e.g., programming, modeling, machine learning, data visualization, and database structures) and to assess how data can be used to solve novel problems.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis', comment=NA}
